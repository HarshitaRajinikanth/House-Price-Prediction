# House-Price-Prediction

House price prediction using machine learning involves building a model that can estimate the selling price of a house based on various features or attributes of the property. Here's a basic gist of the steps involved in this process:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather a dataset that includes information about houses, such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, location, age, amenities, and, most importantly, the actual selling prices of these houses. You can obtain this data from various sources like real estate websites, government databases, or through surveys.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data to make it suitable for machine learning. This may involve handling missing values, encoding categorical variables (like location), scaling numerical features, and splitting the dataset into a training set and a testing set for model evaluation.

3. **Feature Selection/Engineering**: Choose the relevant features that are likely to impact the house price the most. You may also create new features if they could provide valuable information. For example, you might calculate the price per square foot.

4. **Choosing a Model**: Select a machine learning algorithm suitable for regression tasks. Common choices include linear regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and more advanced techniques like gradient boosting and neural networks.

5. **Model Training**: Train your selected model using the training data. The model learns to make predictions by finding the best parameters that minimize the prediction errors.

6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using the testing dataset. Common regression evaluation metrics include Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). A lower value of these metrics indicates a better model.

7. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tune the model by adjusting its hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, number of trees in a random forest, or the architecture of a neural network) to optimize its performance.

8. **Deployment**: Once you are satisfied with the model's performance, you can deploy it for making predictions. Users can input features of a house, and the model will provide an estimated price.

9. **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Continuously monitor the model's performance in a production environment and retrain it periodically with new data to keep it up-to-date and accurate.

10. **Interpretability and Transparency**: Ensure that the model's predictions are interpretable and transparent, especially in cases where it might impact real estate transactions or decisions.
